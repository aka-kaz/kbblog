I'm Kassie, I'm a mixed-methods social science researcher with a background in Economics and Data Analytics. At heart I'm an organizer; I sort data, behaviors, and ideas to create knowledge and give data-driven answers to public policy questions. I study economics and behavioral trends and I use statistical analysis, writing, and design to describe, understand, and draw conclusions about these phenomena.  I am driven by my desire to reconsider academic writing and make data accessible to all readers which I hope to do through report writing, synthesizing complex concepts and data visualizations.
