abstract: The New Employee Survey was designed to gather information on work-related characteristics of new casino employees that could not be collected from any other source. The survey data can help workforce development providers and policymakers better understand the workforce at the Commonwealth’s three casinos. This report summarizes the results of a New Employee survey administered by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) to the incoming employees hired at Encore Boston Harbor (EBH).
